# libbyschuknight.github.io - Personal Website
Website repo for phase 0 EDA - [link to site](http://libbyschuknight.github.io/)

17 March - have decided to redesign this along these lines, partly so can have a go at putting in a drop down menu on small widths:

1. home page
    * image of me
    * a bit about me and what I am doing now
    * links to: blog, github, treehouse, twitter
    * future - embed twitter, embed most recent blog post from wordpress

2. profile page
    * outline of career
    * what doing
    * how to contact

3. devacademy EDA page
    * phases??
    * links to sites
    * image gallery - images of progression of sites, with small description?
